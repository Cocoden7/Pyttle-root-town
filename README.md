First village (Littleroot town) of pokemon 3rd generation (rubis, sapphire, emerald) recreated with python and pygame.

* main.py:  Main code.
* RollingText.py: Module to write the "rolling" dialogues.
* utils.py:  Some useful functions to load and scale images.
* particles.py: Module to build some particles following the feet of the main character.
* temp.py: Useless in the raw code, used by me to debug some things.
